needed functionality for coding work done in The State and
University Library - Statsbiblioteket, of Denmark.

LICENSING

See lib/xstream-license.txt for details.

The bundled program qaScan-<version>.jar contains an inlined versions of
Apache's commons-cli and commons-logging as well as log4j.

RELEASING
When code has been added or changed, do the following:
This will release the current snapshot version and increase the snapshot version in the pom automatic.

git commit & push if you haven't already done so.

mvn release:prepare

  Or speed up the process if you are a test-hating villain:
  
mvn -Darguments='-Dmaven.test.skip=true' release:prepare

  Check the suggested versions. If everything builds and looks ok then

mvn -Darguments='-Dmaven.test.skip=true'  release:perform

  If everything is still OK, perform a

git push

  If something goes wrong, e.g. JavaDoc failing, reset with

git reset origin/$(git branch | grep '\*' | cut -d\  -f2)  --hard
