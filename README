The SB Util project is heavily deprecated.
Do not use it for new projects!

The successor is kb-util: https://github.com/kb-dk/kb-util

        <dependency>
            <groupId>dk.kb.util</groupId>
            <artifactId>kb-util</artifactId>
            <version>1.4.11</version>
        </dependency>

(the version in the dependency snippet is not up to date)

If any sb-util functionality is needed, please port it to
kb-util and use that project instead. Do note that kb-util
requires Java 11.

ABOUT
sbutil is a generic Java utility module containing commonly
needed functionality for coding work done in The State and
University Library - Statsbiblioteket, of Denmark.

LICENSING
Beware that sbutil has a version of xstream inlined in the release jar file.
See lib/xstream-license.txt for details.

The bundled program qaScan-<version>.jar contains an inlined versions of
Apache's commons-cli and commons-logging as well as log4j.

RELEASING
When code has been added or changed, do the following:
This will release the current snapshot version and increase the snapshot version in the pom automatic.

git commit & push if you haven't already done so.

mvn release:prepare

  Or speed up the process if you are a test-hating villain:
  
mvn -Darguments='-Dmaven.test.skip=true' release:prepare

  Check the suggested versions. If everything builds and looks ok then

mvn -Darguments='-Dmaven.test.skip=true'  release:perform

  If everything is still OK, perform a

git push

  If something goes wrong, e.g. JavaDoc failing, reset with

git reset origin/$(git branch | grep '\*' | cut -d\  -f2)  --hard
